# Test prompting AI

## Introduction

This repository is a test of using AI to code, following [Alban Crepel's](https://github.com/AlbanCrepel) classes. The objective is to make an API with only the AI model (I don't code strictly speaking). This exercise only serves to research :

- Existing AI models
- http requests (.http files)

## Facilities

```bash
npm i express
npm i express-basic-auth
```

## Run the project

```bash
node server.js
```
