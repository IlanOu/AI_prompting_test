# Test prompting AI

## Introduction

This repository is a test of using AI to code, following [Alban Crepel's](https://github.com/AlbanCrepel) classes. The objective is to make an API with only the AI model (I don't code strictly speaking). This exercise only serves to research :

- Existing AI models
- http requests (.http files)

## Installations

```bash
npm i express
npm i express-basic-auth
```

For users of VScode, you can install [httpYac](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anweber.vscode-httpyac)

For users of [Jetbrains suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/exploring-http-syntax.html), you can have it natively


## Run the project

```bash
node server.js
```
